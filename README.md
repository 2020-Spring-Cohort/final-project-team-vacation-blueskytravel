# Ideal Vacation Itinerary
## Cle Final Project Team Ideal Vacation Itinerary

Families trying to plan a vacation, kids don't always get the opportunity to help pick the itinerary, and parents are usually very busy and could use an organizational app to help make an easy to edit itinerary for the whole family, where all members can have access and prioritize items, up-vote ideas for vacation events, etc. In general, having an easy to access app to update booking info, check in dates and times, flight times, and wish list for things they'd like to do, and total cost of vacation.

### Minimum Viable Product 
User will be able to add/update/delete all aspects of vacation itinerary. Flight plan, hotel reservations, and things to-do on the vacation. All features will include input for cost, so that user can see total cost of vacation to monitor budget. Users will also be able to prioritize which "to do" ideas are most popular among the party members. (Example, parasailing can be listed as an event and the more votes from the family members it receives, the higher up on the list it goes) 

### Future Features
Ideally, the project would eventually have the ability for a log-in system, where the parents are the only ones who can see/edit cost and budget, and those details are hidden from the children log-in. Children could still add suggestions and vote on ideas, but they would not be able to change things like flight plan and hotel reservations.
